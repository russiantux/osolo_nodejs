a tool to remotely start a minecraft servers. build with node.js and socket.io.
## Dependencies
```
node.js
socket.io
```

## How to use Osolo
Using Osolo is very simple. Simply put Osolo to your minecraft server folder (where ever you put the server files), open command promt, cd into the server folder, and type `node osolo.js`. You then can go to `http://localhost:8080` and access the web page to use Osolo. If you want to use this over the internet, make sure you port-forward `8080`, and connect using `http://{your-IP-here}:8080`.

## Installation
Installation is very simply, just drag and drop all the files in the zip into the folder where your minecraft server files are. Make sure you have a `run.bat` inside the folder, otherwise Osolo will not be able to run the server (will fix it in the future)
